    instructions: "Soak the dates in hot water while you get the rest of the ingredients and start on step 2 (about 5 minutes). The water should be hot to the touch but not hot enough to burn you.\nProcess the almonds in a food processor until coarse almond meal is formed. Add the pecans and process until they are ground up into a coarse meal as well.\nDrain the dates and use your hand to squeeze out excess water. Add the drained dates, cocoa powder, vanilla extract, agave nectar, and salt to the food processor. Process until a smooth paste forms.\nUse a tablespoon measure to help you form the truffles. Pack a heaping tablespoon of the mixture into the tablespoon measure  really pack it in there. Use your fingers to slide the half-rounded ball out of the tablespoon measure, and then use your hands to form a tightly packed ball of truffle goodness. Be gentle with them  I found that they fall apart if you try to roll them into balls. It is best to squish them with your hand into perfect little spheres.\nForm truffles until you use up all the mixture. The last bit that was not enough for a truffle went straight into my mouth. :)\nIf you choose to, gently roll the truffles in the toppings of your choice. I had some turtle crunch sprinkles, unsweetened coconut flakes, and extra cocoa powder. The cocoa powder definitely gives the the truffles an extra dark chocolate kick, so if you dont like the bitterness of the cocoa powder then dont use that as a topping.",
